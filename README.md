## TL;DR

Please head over to the [Discussions](https://github.com/spurin/KCNA-Study-Group/discussions) forum which is the main area of this repository.

## Overview 📌

Hello and welcome aboard the KCNA - Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate - Study Group! This repository is your platform for GitHub-based discussions where you can dive into your studies with peers pursuing the CNCF/Linux Foundations Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate Qualification.

Achieving the KCNA Qualification is like obtaining a golden ticket, showcasing your fundamental understanding of Kubernetes and Cloud Native principles. This credential is designed to validate your knowledge of Cloud Native Architecture, Container Orchestration, Kubernetes Fundamentals, Cloud Native Observability, and Cloud Native Application Delivery. Think of it as your passport to the exhilarating world of Cloud Native!

## Layout 📘

The design of this study group mirrors the curriculum of my course, 'Dive Into Cloud Native - Kubernetes, Containers and the KCNA Exam'. In the full course, for each section there's video content, quizzes resembling KCNA exam questions and hands-on labs and challenges. But remember, the study group isn't exclusive to this content—you're free to discuss or reference materials from other KCNA content creators or other content that is available. The ultimate goal is soaring success in the exam! 🏆
